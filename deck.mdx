## Hello!

<Steps>

I'm Matei.

I really like computers.

Full-stack developer.

**Way** too much experience with DevOps.

</Steps>

<Notes>

Hello, everyone! I'm Matei, I'm a 4th year computer science major in Warren College.

I really like computers. I've liked them since I was like 5 apparently, according to my parents, and I've always loved tinkering with them.
Since then, I've done less of "messing around randomly with system settings" and more actual coding.

I like to consider myself a generalist in computer science, and I've tried to strive for that by generally just learning as much as I can
at every layer of computers, from physics and transistors to JavaScripts frameworks, which are, probably like, 600 layers of abstraction above
transistors.

I will concede that I've spent way more time on DevOps than anyone who considers themselves a generalist should, despite the fact that "DevOps"
as a term implies generalism. I've deployed computer infrastructure in pretty much every way, from bare-metal servers to Kubernetes clusters of
various sizes.

## Quick disclaimers

<Steps>

I talk a lot.

Don't hesitate to interrupt and ask questions!

✋ on Zoom.

</Steps>

---

## TL;DR for talk

<Steps>

A quick tutorial on containers.

Why would we want to use them?

Quick demo using Slurm and HPCG.

</Steps>

<Notes>

Alright, so what am I actually presenting for you today?

Well, I'm going to give y'all a quick small tutorial on containers, what they are, how to make them, and maybe some more in-depth technical details if anyone is interested.

We'll also talk about why we would want to use them for this competition in particular, and just some other general usecases.

We'll do this workshop of sorts using a quick demo on Slurm and HPCG. The idea is that we want to use container workflows to make a Slurm cluster and install programs on it
that we'll use for running our cluster, such as the HPCG benchmark.

</Notes>

---

## What are containers?

<Steps>

A special kind of virtual machine.

The idea is simple: "why duplicate the kernel?"

Re-use kernel across every "virtual machine".

</Steps>

<Notes>

- Cover the basic difference between a VM and a container.

Maybe even annotate the famous graphic using Zoom.

</Notes>

---

## Why containers?

<Steps>

Keeps things the same everywhere.

Installing applications is easy and isolated!

No need to futz around with configurations.

</Steps>

<Notes>

Give anecdotes on why it's important to keep things the same anywhere. Configuration management like Ansible and stuff maybe.

Installing applications is as easy as running a container, especially for environments that are highly volatile.

You may not futz with configurations but you will futz around with environment variables, but it's still somewhat easier overall.
Envvars are easier to set than configuration files.

</Notes>

---

## "Oh, you mean Docker!"

<Steps>

I mean OCI containers.

They can be run by different kinds of container daemons.

Podman, Docker, etc.

</Steps>

---

## Singularity

<Image

style={{
    width: '30vh',
    height: '30vh',
}}
>
</Image>

Another container platform designed for HPC.

---

## Singularity vs Docker

<Steps>

- Has few security restrictions
- Higher performance!
- Works with Docker containers!
- Less isolated features

</Steps>

---

## How to Singularity?

<Steps>

- Install Singularity on host machine
- Download Singularity container (or build a .sif)
- `$ singularity run random-container.sif`

</Steps>

---

## How could we use it?

<Steps>

Standard platform for all our needs in the competition.

Setup Slurm, dependencies for projects, etc.

Environment consistent across all nodes, no need to reinstall.

</Steps>

---

## Starting Simple

I'll show you an example definition file for Singularity.

We'll then install Slurm, dependencies, etc.

## Next Steps

Let's get Slurm properly set up.

We need to configure our cluster first.

[Thank God for the Internet.](https://slurm.schedmd.com/configurator.html)

---

## Let's get it installed!

Now we just need to:
- add the configuration file to the container
- enable the daemon service on the worker nodes
- enable the controller service on the controller nodes

Sadly, the easiest way to separate is just two separate containers.

# So far, so good!

<Steps>

HPCG is up next.

It would be nice not to leave compilation in container.

Keeping containers clean and lean is good practice.

</Steps>

---

## How do we keep it clean?

<Steps>

**Multi-stage building!**

One stage compiles all of our various binaries (like HPCG).

The other stage (the one with Slurm) gets the binaries to run.

</Steps>

# Tying it all together

<Steps>

Each node will have these containers running.

Now they need to connect.

</Steps>

---

# Some luck!

<Steps>

Containers can be searched via hostname or IP!

Singularity doesn't do network isolation.

Just `singularity run hpcg-slurm.dif`!

</Steps>

---

# What's next?

<Steps>

- **The (Slurm) world is your oyster!**
- Run the HPCG benchmark with `mpirun /opt/xhpcg ...` 
- Connect with a Jupyter notebook
- Add more nodes!

</Steps>
