# Using Singularity in HPC contexts

This is a quick tutorial slide deck I made to present ways to use Singularity
containers in order to deploy reproducible Slurm task nodes for usage in HPC
(High-Performance Computing) contexts.

# Usage

```sh
npm install --global yarn # unless you already have Yarn installed
yarn && yarn start
```

# Disclaimer

This is all rather new to me, and I can't say I'm the leading authority on any
of this stuff. [Let me know](mailto:matei@gard.us) if there's anything in these
slides that's wrong or could do with a bit of improvement. I also accept PR's!
